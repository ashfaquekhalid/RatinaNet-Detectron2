# RatinaNet-Detectron2
## Trained RatinaNet model using open-source library detectron2 to detect cars and peoples in the image.

Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research's next generation software system that implements state-of-the-art object detection algorithms. It is a ground-up rewrite of the previous version, Detectron, and it originates from maskrcnn-benchmark. It consists of:

* Training recipes for object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, semantic segmentation and keypoint detection.
* 80+ pre-trained models to use for fine-tuning (or training afresh).
* Dataset support for popular vision datasets such as COCO, Cityscapes, LVIS, PASCAL VOC, ADE20k.
